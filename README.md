# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on Credit Card Fraud Detection using machine learning techniques to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The dataset contains transaction details, and the goal is to build a predictive model that accurately detects fraudulent activities.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization and statistical analysis of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.
- Machine Learning Models: Implementing and evaluating different models.
- Performance Metrics: Analyzing accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook for implementation and visualization

## Installation and Setup
## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required dependencies

## Usage
1. Load the dataset.
2. Perform data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.
3. Train machine learning models.
4. Evaluate model performance using various metrics.
5. Make predictions on new transactions.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (optional, if implemented)

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models like LSTMs.
- Improve feature engineering techniques.
- Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI.
- Integrate real-time fraud detection.
